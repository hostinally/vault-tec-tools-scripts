## 🚀 How to Use the Scripts

These scripts work alongside Vault-Tec Tools in Fallout 4 Sim Settlements to improve automation and management. You do not need to open or edit the scripts unless directed by advanced users or specific instructions.

Here is how to make sure the scripts are active and working:

1. **Place Scripts in the Correct Folder**  
   Each script should be placed in the Vault-Tec Tools scripts folder within your Fallout 4 data directory or as instructed by the mod documentation. Often, the mod manager or Fallout itself will handle this when you install a mod or script.

2. **Launch Fallout 4 with Mods Enabled**  
   Start the game normally or via your mod manager ensuring Vault-Tec Tools and Sim Settlements mods are enabled.

3. **Use Vault-Tec Tools In-Game Menus**  
   Open the Vault-Tec Tools interface in the game. The scripts you downloaded will run automatically or be selectable within this menu.

4. **Check Script Effects**  
   Look for enhanced automation features in Sim Settlements, such as settlement building assistance, resource management, or custom alerts.

If something goes wrong, try reinstalling the scripts or consult the mod community forums for help.
